# Personal Password Manager Project

## Description
This is a personal project I developed while studying for my BSc in Cybersecurity at the Open University. It was created to deepen my understanding of secure password handling, Python programming, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

The project allows users to store passwords for various services, retrieve them securely, and check the strength of their passwords. It serves as an educational tool for learning key principles of cybersecurity and applying them in practice.

## Features
- Store and retrieve passwords for different services (e.g., Gmail, Facebook, etc.).
- Check the strength of a password based on common security guidelines.
- Simple and effective password management using file storage (with potential improvements like encryption).

## Technologies Used
- Python 3 for logic and functionality.
- Basic file handling for password storage.

## Educational Background
This project was inspired by my BSc studies in Cybersecurity at the Open University. It reflects core cybersecurity concepts, such as password security and data handling, learned during my degree.

## Future Improvements
- Encrypt stored passwords using Pythonâ€™s cryptography library.
- Implement a GUI for easier interaction.
- Migrate password storage to a secure database.
